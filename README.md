# CowinAppointmentTracker

created a script to track 18-44 age group vaccine appointments.
edit variables.py to match your settings.

Steps to run -
1) pip install -r requirements.txt.
2) change variables.py to match your settings.
3) run the script - python check_for_appointment.py

If your desired vaccination slot is available, it will start alarm. YOU WILL DEFINELTY KNOW THIS IS THE ALARM. Keep the script running. 

I have added mailing functionality too, it works, but setting it up is tedious(not recommended). File name - check_for_appointment_and_send_mail
